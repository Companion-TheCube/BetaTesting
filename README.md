# 🧪 TheCube Beta Testing Hub

Welcome to the **official beta testing hub** for Companion, TheCube.

This repository is where we coordinate **closed beta testing** with our Kickstarter Debugger-tier backers. It includes changelogs, general testing instructions, and issue tracking for hardware-level features and platform-wide behaviors.

---

## 📦 What This Repo Is For

This repository serves as a central space to:

- 📜 Post **changelogs** and firmware release notes for beta builds
- ✅ Track **feature testing checklists** that don’t belong to a specific app
- 🐛 Collect **bugs or feedback** related to:
  - General firmware
  - Hardware behavior (e.g. power, boot, I/O)
  - System-wide UX and UI components

If your feedback doesn’t fit into a specific app repo, it belongs here.

## 🗂 Project Board

We manage beta testing tasks via a public [GitHub Project board](https://github.com/orgs/Companion-TheCube/projects/1), organized by testing status:

Each card links to an issue that includes testing instructions and checkboxes. Backers can comment on any issue with results, screenshots, logs, or notes.
